## Description

In this project, I refactored existing HTML and CSS code to improve web accessibility, following industry best practices. The goal was to enhance user experience for individuals with disabilities, optimize the website for search engines, and meet business and legal standards for accessibility. Key improvements include semantic HTML elements, ARIA attributes, and more consistent styling.

## Task 
To successfully solve the challenge, these tasks below were taken into account:

- Replacing non-semantic elements to semantic elements (HTML).
- Cleaning redundant CSS stylings.
- Optimizing html file structurally.
- Added title for the webpage.

## Deployment

The final webpage for this can be accessed here: https://leontran44.github.io/horiseon-marketing-code-refactor/

Users can access the HTML source code through the repo or within a Chromium/Firefox browser by pressing `F12`, `CTRL+SHIFT+I` (Windows) or `CMD+SHIFT+I` (MacOS). 

## Sample
